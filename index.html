            <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
          
            <p>
                Pam Weekes and Connie McDonald created Levain Bakery in 1995, out of their passions for food, friendship
                and hard work.

                Competitive swimmers and triathletes, Pam and Connie passed their grueling workouts by engaging in
                passionate conversations about starting their own company and baking, which ultimately inspired them to
                leave their respective careers in fashion and finance. They opened a small bread shop in 1995, which
                they named Levain Bakery.

                One day, they created an ultimate chocolate chip walnut cookie to give them energy while training for a
                triathlon. They decided to sell a batch in their bakery, and they flew off the shelves. An icon was
                born. The cozy shop on West 74th Street quickly became a neighborhood favorite and a destination for
                epicurious travelers from around the world, hungry for the world-famous six-ounce cookies.

                From the start they baked everything fresh on-site each day and donated the day’s leftovers to charity
                each night, actions that remain solidly in place almost 25 years later. Levain Bakery now has eight
                locations with more to come, plus ecommerce gift boxes, and recently made its debut in grocery stores
                with the debut of Levain Bakery Frozen Cookies!
